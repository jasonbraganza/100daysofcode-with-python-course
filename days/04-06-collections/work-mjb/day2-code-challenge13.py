"""
There is this great ML article Predict Movie Rating. In this week's code challenge we use its data set to get the 20 highest rated directors based on their average movie IMDB ratings.

Steps:

    As mentioned in the article the dataset is here, but we provided a copy in the repo's 13/ subfolder.

    Parse the movie_metadata.csv, using csv.DictReader you get a bunch of OrderedDicts from which you only need the following k,v pairs:

    OrderedDict([...
                ('director_name', 'Lawrence Kasdan'),   
                ...
                ('movie_title', 'Mumford\xa0'),
                ...
                ('title_year', '1999'),
                ...
                ('imdb_score', '6.9'),
                ...

    Only consider directors with a minimum of 4 movies, otherwise you get misrepresentative data. However going to min 5 movies we miss Sergio Leone :(

    Take movies of year >= 1960.

    Print the top 20 highest rated directors with their movies ordered desc on rating.
